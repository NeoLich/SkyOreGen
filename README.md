Minecraft Data Pack:  SkyOreGen (Skyblock Ore Generator)

SkyOreGen is a data pack that will replace the cobblestone and basalt from generators with ores and blocks determined by the tier of generator.

SkyOreGen can be used on any skyblock map all necessary items for the data pack are given through advancements and two villagers summoned from books.

I am making a world for this pack with some more features and advancements.

Future for this pack I plan to continue to with optimization and flush out the advancements.

The rates and cost of the generators are not easily editable if it feels like the pack is too lopsided let me know and I can see about adjusting rates and uploading a second version or instructions on how to edit them yourself.

Any other bugs or problems please let me know.
